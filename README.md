# Friday.TypeScript
### What is Friday.TypeScript?
Friday.TypeScript is a general-purpose frontend framework for solving everyday tasks in any projects.
There is a Friday.NET framework for backend development on C#/.NET. https://github.com/BruceBayne/Friday.NET

Currently this framework is not documented and a little bit messy, but I plan to make it more modular and make documented, as soon as I finish extracting reusable code from my last project.

Framework actively interacts with KnockoutJS MVVM framework, but not directly depends on it, except Friday.Knockout part. I'm planing to add Friday.Angular and Friday.ReactJS in future, with specific code for this frameworks.

### Why it's called Friday?
Original idea was to spend some time each friday, to extract reusable code from commercial projects and commit them to this framework. But life put everything in its place and commits occur without any schedule :)

Feel free to use any part of this framework as you with, but don't rely on it for now, because I oftenly commit breaking changes to my code, while learning new things or changing my ideology of how code should look.
